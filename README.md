# NiightAP-Discord-Bot

## NiightAP is a general use discord bot that will be slowly developed over time.

NiightAP is currently a pre-released discord bot. As I develop the bot I will gradually update the releases on github. Once I feel that NiightAP is at a point that it can be fully release I will provide a link so that the public can use the bot.

# How to host your own bot with this code

### Before anything make sure that you have [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed, as well as [discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro.html)

After that download this project: [Click here to download](https://github.com/NiightAP/Discord-Bot/archive/main.zip)

Extract the files from the .zip file

In your text editor of choice make a file in the folder named ".env" without the quotes.

In the .env file copy and paste: "DISCORD_TOKEN=" without the quotes.

After the equal sign pase your discor bot token from your [discord dev page](https://discord.com/developers/applications)

Save the file then start an instance of command prompt.

In command prompt cd to you discord bot files, then type "python bot.py" without quotes.

If your bot starts, congrats! You have a working bot. If your bot does not start please look over these instructions again to make sure you did not miss anything as all of the instructions here are important and needed for you to start and use the bot.
